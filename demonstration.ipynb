Be sure to fulfill all prerequisites as specified in the [readme](README.md), especially the availability of the two pretrained models, both of which are available for download on Zenodo (find the classifier [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5159501#.Ytq28ITP3-g) and the labeler [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5550387#.Ytq3QYTP3-g) (use the model named `roberta_dropout_linear_layer_multilabel.ckpt` for optimal performance)).
